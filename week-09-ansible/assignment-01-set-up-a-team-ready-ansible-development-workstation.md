# Assignment 01 — Set Up a Team-Ready Ansible Development Workstation

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will prepare an isolated and reusable Ansible development workstation.

You will install Ansible and supporting tools inside a Python virtual environment, configure VS Code, prepare SSH access, configure Git and pre-commit hooks, and document the complete setup.

This workstation will be used as the Ansible controller in upcoming assignments.

---

# Task 1 — Create and Initialize the Ansible Workspace

## Goal

Create the assignment workspace, initialize a Git repository, prepare the required directories, and add Git ignore rules for local and sensitive files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the `ansible-onboarding` path, `ls -la` output, and `git status` confirming the Git repository is on the `main` branch

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 2 — Create the Virtual Environment and Install Ansible Tools

## Goal

Create an isolated Python virtual environment and install Ansible and the required validation tools without modifying the system Python environment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 2 — Terminal showing the active `(.venv)` environment, `which ansible`, `ansible --version`, `ansible-lint --version`, `yamllint --version`, and `pre-commit --version`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 3 — Configure VS Code for Ansible Development

## Goal

Configure Visual Studio Code to use the project’s Python virtual environment and provide validation support for Python, YAML, and Ansible files.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — VS Code Extensions panel showing the Ansible, YAML, and Python extensions installed

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — VS Code showing `.vscode/settings.json` and `.editorconfig` open side by side, with the required settings clearly visible

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 4 — Create the Baseline Ansible Configuration

## Goal

Create a reusable `ansible.cfg` file containing the default settings that will be used in this workspace and upcoming Ansible assignments.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 5 — `ansible.cfg` open in VS Code or another editor, showing the complete configuration

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 6 — Terminal showing `ansible --version` with the `ansible.cfg` path and the output of `ansible-config dump --only-changed`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 5 — Configure SSH Readiness

## Goal

Prepare SSH key authentication, load the key into the SSH agent, configure reusable SSH client settings, and understand how trusted host fingerprints are stored.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 7 — Terminal showing `ssh-add -l` with the ED25519 key loaded and the SSH configuration verification output

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 6 — Configure Git Identity and Pre-commit Hooks

## Goal

Configure your Git identity and install pre-commit hooks that validate YAML and Ansible files before commits are created.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 8 — Terminal showing your Git full name, Git email, default branch, successful `pre-commit install` output, and `.git/hooks/pre-commit`

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 7 — Test the Complete Workstation Setup

## Goal

Verify that Ansible, the linting tools, Git hooks, SSH agent, and Git ignore rules are working correctly.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal showing `pre-commit run --all-files` completing successfully

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 10 — Terminal showing `ansible --version` with the project configuration path and `ssh-add -l` with the ED25519 key loaded

Add your screenshot here.

---

# Task 8 — Create the README and Onboarding Checklist

## Goal

Document the completed Ansible workstation setup and create a reusable checklist for preparing another workstation in the future.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 11 — Terminal showing the final `ansible-onboarding` project structure

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 12 — VS Code Markdown preview showing your full name, project summary, and part of the “New Machine? Do This” checklist

Add your screenshot here.
