# Assignment 02 — Provision Linux VMs with Terraform and Run Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will use Terraform to provision three or four Ubuntu Linux Virtual Machines on either Microsoft Azure or Amazon Web Services.

You will configure SSH key-based authentication, organize the servers using a custom Ansible inventory, and run Ansible ad-hoc commands across individual hosts and inventory groups.

---

# Task 1 — Create the Multi-Host Lab Structure

## Goal

Create a separate project directory for the multi-host lab and prepare the Terraform, Ansible, and documentation files.

This project will use the Git repository and Ansible controller prepared in Assignment 01.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 1 — Terminal showing the complete `ansible-adhoc-lab` project structure

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 2 — Terminal showing `git status --short` with the new project files and updated `.gitignore`

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 2 — Create the Terraform Configuration

## Goal

Create the Terraform configuration required to provision three or four Ubuntu Linux VMs on your selected cloud platform.

Complete only one option:

- Option A — Microsoft Azure
- Option B — Amazon Web Services

Do not configure both providers for this assignment.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 3 — Terraform configuration showing the three or four server roles and the `for_each` or `count` implementation

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 4 — Terraform configuration showing SSH restricted to the controller IP and HTTP allowed only for web hosts

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 5 — Terraform output configuration showing how public IP addresses are associated with the server roles

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 3 — Provision the Infrastructure with Terraform

## Goal

Initialize and validate the Terraform configuration, review the execution plan, provision the selected three or four VMs, and retrieve their public IP addresses.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 6 — Final `terraform apply` output showing `Apply complete`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 7 — `terraform output public_ips` showing the role-to-IP mapping for all three or four VMs

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 8 — Azure Portal or AWS Management Console showing all three or four VMs in the `Running` state, with their role-based names visible

Add your screenshot here.

# Task 4 — Verify SSH Key-Based Access

## Goal

Verify that each managed VM can be accessed from the Ansible controller using SSH key-based authentication.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 9 — Terminal showing successful SSH hostname output from all VMs

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Add your task notes here.

---

# Task 5 — Create the Custom Ansible Inventory

## Goal

Create an Ansible inventory file that groups the managed VMs by role.

The inventory allows Ansible to run commands against all servers, or only specific groups such as `web`, `app`, or `db`.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — `inventory.ini` showing the `web`, `app`, and `db` groups

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Output of `ansible-inventory -i inventory.ini --graph`

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Add your task notes here.

---

# Task 6 — Run Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands

## Goal

Run Ansible ad-hoc commands from the controller to verify connectivity, check server information, and manage packages and services across inventory groups.

This task proves that the inventory is working and that Ansible can control multiple managed VMs without writing a playbook.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 12 — Output of `ansible all -i inventory.ini -m ping`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 13 — Output of `ansible all -i inventory.ini -m command -a "uptime"`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 14 — Output of `ansible web -i inventory.ini -m apt -a "name=nginx state=present update_cache=yes" --become`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 15 — Output of `ansible web -i inventory.ini -m service -a "name=nginx state=started enabled=yes" --become`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Output of `ansible all -i inventory.ini -m apt -a "name=htop state=present update_cache=yes" --become`

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 17 — Output of `ansible web -i inventory.ini -m command -a "systemctl is-active nginx"`

Add your screenshot here.
