# Assignment — Deploy EpicBook with Terraform and Ansible Roles

Part of the DevOps Micro Internship (DMI) with Agentic AI

---

## Purpose

In this assignment, you will deploy the EpicBook web application using Terraform and Ansible roles.

Terraform provisions the cloud infrastructure, including one Ubuntu VM and one managed MySQL database. Ansible roles configure the VM, install required software, deploy the EpicBook application, configure Nginx, connect the app to the managed MySQL database, and verify the deployment.

---

# Task 1 — Set Up the Project Folder Layout

## Goal

Create the project folder structure for Terraform and Ansible roles.

Terraform will be used to provision the cloud infrastructure. Ansible roles will be used to configure the VM and deploy the EpicBook application.

---

# Task 5 — Create the Main Ansible Playbook

## Goal

Create the main Ansible playbook that runs the required roles in the correct order.

The `site.yml` file will call the `common`, `nginx`, and `epicbook` roles.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 10 — `site.yml` showing the roles in the correct order

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 11 — Output of `ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini site.yml --syntax-check`

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 6 — Create the `common` Role

## Goal

Create the `common` role to prepare the Ubuntu VM with the basic packages required for the EpicBook deployment.

This role handles the common server setup before Nginx and the application are configured.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 12 — `roles/common/tasks/main.yml` showing the common setup tasks

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

Answer the following in your own words:

**1. What is the responsibility of the `common` role?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 7 — Create the `nginx` Role

## Goal

Create the `nginx` role to install Nginx and configure it as a reverse proxy for the EpicBook application.

Nginx will receive browser traffic on port `80` and forward it to the EpicBook Node.js application running on the VM.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 13 — `roles/nginx/tasks/main.yml` showing Nginx installation and site configuration tasks

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 14 — `roles/nginx/templates/epicbook.conf.j2` showing the reverse proxy configuration

Add your screenshot here.

---

### Notes

**1. What is the responsibility of the `nginx` role?**

Add your answer here.

---

**2. Why is Nginx configured as a reverse proxy in this deployment?**

Add your answer here.

---

**3. Why should the application port come from `group_vars/web.yml` instead of being hard-coded?**

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 8 — Create the `epicbook` Role

## Goal

Create the `epicbook` role to deploy the EpicBook application, connect it to the managed MySQL database, and run the application on port `8080` using PM2.

### Evidence

#### Screenshot 15 — `roles/epicbook/tasks/main.yml` showing application deployment tasks

Add your screenshot here.

---

#### Screenshot 16 — Task or file showing how the database connection is configured, with secrets hidden

Add your answer here.

---

# Task 9 — Create Group Variables

## Goal

Create reusable variables for the EpicBook deployment.

The `group_vars/web.yml` file stores values that can be reused across the Ansible roles.

### Evidence
